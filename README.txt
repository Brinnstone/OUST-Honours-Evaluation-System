PYTHON VERSION 3.12.1 WAS USED

Our team used a windows 11 operating environment, but most windows environments should work as well. 
Before the application can be ran, make sure that Python has been installed onto each device that will be running both the client and server applications.
Most modern-day versions of Python should work when running our application, 
but our team used Python 3.12.1 to develop and implement our project which can be downloaded from here (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3121/).
If you are installing Python for the first time, please make sure to select the “install to PATH” checkbox so that you will be able to execute the code in windows command terminals.
No external libraries were used so there should be no need to “pip install” anything.  
 
Once Python has been installed, please double click the application.py file to launch our menu system for selecting which tiered application to run.
This is the intended way to launch the program, but you can manually double click the desired .py files as mentioned further on.
This should open a windows command terminal with the application.py.
If you want to use the two-tiered application, then you will type “1” when prompted to.
By default, the program will open both the client and server applications on the same machine but at any point one or the other can be closed if you are testing the application on 
different machines on the same network. For example, on PC1 you can have the server running and on PC2 you can be using the client.  
 
It is assumed that the application will only be running on a local network, therefore, unless you go into the source code and hard code the server’s public
IPv4 address into the client, the application won’t function across different networks. 
If you choose to run the program through an IDE such as Visual Studio Code, then please run the respecitve .py file applications
in either the “two-tiered applications”  or "three-tiered applicaions" folder in separate IDE’s.
The program should still function correctly, but it was intended to be used in a windows command terminal.
Alternatively, you can also double click on all of the .py files inside of either the “two-tiered applications” or "three-tiered applications" folder
to execute them in a windows command terminal like how the application.py is executed.
